Comp 20 Learning Portfolio
Hayden Wolff

1. This repository contains my work from Tufts Comp20 (web
programming) for Fall 2018.

2. My favorite assignment was assignment 3. This assignment
modified the web game 2048 so that high scores were not just
stored in local storage but in a database. I liked this assignment
because I felt like it tested my understanding of how a client,
server, and database all interact together. I had to do a lot of
research on my own which is one of the important skills in web 
programming. Additionally, it was cool to take someone else's 
pre-exisiting project on Github and then improve it to add more
functionality.

3. The most important thing I learned this course is that "web
programming is a cesspool." It really is just taking other
peoples' code and gluing it together. 
    - Example 1: Assignment 3 NPM install. I had no idea what was
                 really going on the entire time. It was all just
                 depending on other peoples' stuff and hoping it
                 won't break. The video you showed us of the ducks running is an accurate description of this. 
    - Example 2: Using a ton of APIs-- MBTA, Google Maps, Spotify, etc.
                 Almost all the stuff I made this semester was just taking
                 someone else's code and using it to make my own project.

4. I wasn't originally planning on taking security but now I definitely
 want to take it! I really wasn't aware of how much development is done
 without a single thought going towards security and I don't want to be
 part of that problem. I'd like to learn more about vulnerabilities in
 software and how to make my software more robust.
