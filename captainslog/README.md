* Comp 20 Lab 7 (Captains Log)

1) All parts of this lab have been correctly
implemented to the best of my knowledge. When a page is
closed and reopened an entry must be entered before the 
old entries also appear, but I assumed this was okay because
it was not specified in the lab and it is how the example worked.

2) Talked to Josh about cookies.

3) Approximately 1.5 hours.
