Assignment 2 COMP20

All parts of this project have been correctly implemented
except when the closest station is calculated polylines are
drawn to more than one station. Luckily because this program
will be run from Tufts and the order in which the stations
are iterated over the line is just drawn to Alewife and Davis.
Consider it a *feature* not a bug. I ran out of time because
I had of comp40 arith and midterm :(

I used Ming's Github references to figure out how to do
XML requests and parsing JSON data. I also used the MBTA 
API and Google Maps API. I also used the linked Haversine
formula to calculate distance.

I spent around 10 hours on this project.
