1) All parts of this lab have been correctly implemented. The resizing of the browser width results in a correct responsive image display from a sprite sheet. 

2) I discussed this assignment with Rachel Ginsberg because I was confused about how negative values work in CSS. It was weird to me that even to the right/down if the anchor is set at 0,0 on the left the values are negative.

3) Approximately 1.5 - 2 hours.
