    <h3>Comp 20 Assignment 4 Hayden Wolff</h3>
    <div id="sect_header">I. Introduction</div>

    <div id="sect_text">
    This is a report to identify security and privacy vulnerabilities in Anna's Comp20 Assignment 3. Several
    of these vulnerabilities are in the <a href ="https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf">
    OWASP Top 10 (2017).</a> Therefore, they are crucial to fix. The OWASP Top 10 is a document that highlights current dangers in security for web applications.
    </div>
    <div id="sect_header">II. Methodology</div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    I first did black box testing by performing attacks without
    knowing what Anna's source code was. During this process I used
    both curl and bash scripts. I was able to find many vulnerabilities simply with these two tools. 
    Afterwards, I looked through Anna's source code to find more
    vulnerabilities. I used no external tools during this process.
    </div>
    <div id="sect_header">III. Abstract of Findings</div>
    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    Cross-Site Scripting, also known as XSS, is in the OWASP top 10
    vulnerabilities as number 7. An attacker can inject malicious instructions
    often through user input. XSS becomes dangerous when JavaScript is injected
    so that the attacker can:
    <ul>
        <li>Access sensitive user information in cookies</li>
        <li>Send the user to another website (often malicious)</li>
        <li>Modify the page (make the user think they're doing one thing when they're
        actually doing something else)</li>
        <li>Log keystrokes/other user inputs to record private information (credit
        card numbers, passwords, etc).</li>
    <ul> 
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Mongo Injection
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    Injection attacks (in this case a Mongo injection) is number 1 in the OWASP top 10. In this kind of attack, "the attacker's goal 
    is to achieve uintendedbehavior of the database query by altering query parameters." 
    <a href ="https://www.owasp.org/images/e/ed/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf">
    (Patrick Spiegel, 2016). </a>
    Although Mongo is a NoSQL database so it is immune to SQL
    injections, it still is vulnerable to injections. Frequently,
    NoSQL databases are used to store user data and through
    injection attacks an attacker can:
    <ul>
        <li>View sensitive data stored in the database</li>
        <li>Perform arbitrary operations on the database, modifying what is stored</li>
    <ul> 
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack (DDOS)
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    A DDOS attack disrupts the normal flow of traffic to a server or network by sending a high volume of requests to
    then slow it down or crash it. It is often done with a network of many bots (a botnet). When this is done the attacker can:
    <ul>
        <li>Slow or shut down a server so that legitimate requests cannot be done</li>
        <li>Deactivate a service so other break-ins can then
        occur</li>
    <ul> 
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Broken Access Control
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    Broken Access Control is ranked 5 on the OWASP top 10. Unauthorized API access acts as a gateway for other attacks because
    an attacker can act outside of their intended permissions. When this is done the attacker can:
    <ul>
        <li>Elevate their privilege (act like a user
        without being logged in, acting as an admin)</li>
        <li>Access/manipulate data that should not be available</li>
        <li>Change the key to a different user to tamper with another
        person's account</li>
    <ul> 
    </div>
    <div id="sect_header">IV. Issues Found</div>
    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Issue: XSS
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    Location Found: index.js in /submit post route.
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Severity: High. XSS can very easily compromise
    a user's privacy and additionally break an entire website
    with doing something as simple as redirecting it (which doesn't
    allow a user to access it).
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Description: Because the code does not check for special characters
    in user input, it is possible to inject scripts. This was the first
    vulnerability I checked for. Upon realizing that the website 
    trusted user input, I used curl to send a username
    that wasn't actually a username but rather a script that redirected the page.
    <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    Rather than just inserting fields that the user provides in its original form the input 
    should be cleaned. Below is how fields are inserted (without being checked first).
    <div id="code-ex">
        var toInsert = { <div id="tiny-space"></div>
                'username': request.body.username, <div id="tiny-space"></div>
                'score': request.body.score, <div id="tiny-space"></div>
                'grid': request.body.grid, <div id="tiny-space"></div>
                'created_at': new Date(),<div id="tiny-space"></div>
            };<div id="tiny-space"></div>
    </div>

    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Proof of Vulnerability <div id="small-space"></div>
    <img src="xss_example.gif" alt= "Gif of Heroku page redirecting to Giphy">
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Above: Redirects 2048 scores to Giphy
    </div>
    <div id=sect_text>
    Resolution: Do not trust user input. Validate and clean user input
    before inserting it into a database or displaying it on a page. The
    following code can be used to strip characters that are often associated with malicious user input. Additionally, limiting the
    number of characters in a field can also be a good idea.
    <div id="code-ex">
    var username = request.body.username; <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    username = username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); // remove special chars <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    var toInsert = { <div id="tiny-space"></div>
        "username": username, <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    };<div id="tiny-space"></div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Issue: Mongo Injection
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    Location Found: index.js in /scores.json get route
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Severity: High. Mongo injections can be used to both modify
    pre-existing database information or access information that
    should be private in the database. This can compromise a client's
    privacy and/or modify the client's stored information.
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Description: I found this vulnerability through black box testing. I knew that I was able to access the data of specific 
    database entries by entering a query string, so I figured if I 
    used a "weird" username and tested for not equal it should dump
    the entirety of the Mongo database. It did.
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    I just had to add this query string to the URL:
    <div id="code-ex">
    https://lab8-11-7-18.herokuapp.com/scores.json?username[$ne]=a_username_no_one_entered </div>
    Proof of Vulnerability: Just that single query string dumped
    the entire Mongo database into my browser (shown below):
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    <img src="image_dump.jpg" alt= "Dumped database (a ton of data revealed)">
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Resolution: Use <a href ="https://github.com/vkarpov15/mongo-sanitize"> mongo-sanitize.</a> "For the passionately lazy, a
    standalone module that sanitizes inputs against query selector
    injection attacks." It will strip out any keys that start with '$'
    and it can be passed to MongoDB. 
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Issue: DDOS
    </div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    Location Found: index.js in /submit post route
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Severity: High. A DDOS attack can not only restrict access to
    a website but often when doing so the service becomes vulnerable
    to other attacks. 
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Description: It was a bit harder to test a DDOS attack, but I looked
    through Anna's code and discovered that there were no limitations
    on requests coming from a given source (or even a lot coming from distributed services). 
    I could not fully test a DDOS attack because
    I did not want to charge Anna extra money for overflowing her Mongo
    database, but I wrote a simple script to use curl to send a bunch of
    submit requests to the server. Below is the script 
    (note that I could have used an infinite loop but again didn't want to charge her money).
    <div id="code-ex">
    #!/bin/bash <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    for ((i=1; i<=1000; i++)) <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    do <div id="tiny-space"></div>
        curl --data "username=hacked!&score=6670&grid={}" https://lab8-11-7-18.herokuapp.com/submit <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    done <div id="tiny-space"></div>
    echo "done"
    </div>
    Although I could not perform a full DDOS attack, it could be done.
    DDOS attacks are what I wrote in this single script but
    then performed on a distributed bot net. I am just one person with
    a single computer, so this script would not be sufficient to break
    the server. However, if there were many computers running this same
    script a DDOS attack could be performed. There is nothing that
    prevents this in Anna's website.

    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Evident that many requests are sent in a very short period of time. <div id="small-space"></div>
    Resolution: Use <a href ="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit"> express rate limit node package.</a> It limits the same 
    IP address to only so many requests. For more robust purposes, there are other services such as Cloudfare
    that offer protection against DDOS attacks.

    <div id="sect_text_bold">
    Issue: Broken Access Control
    </div>
     <div id="sect_text">
    Location Found: index.js, line 10.
    <div id="small-space"></div>
    Severity: Medium. Broken access control allows for cross-origin resource sharing
    with no restrictions. This is rated medium in its severity because other protection
    measures can be put in place to protect data from being shared. However, it is much safer to just restrict usage from the beginning. <div id="small-space"></div>
    Description: Any other website can access selected resources from this website. This means that
    private information that is stored (such as a username, password, etc.) can be
    accessed. It would be beneficial to limit cross-origin resource sharing to specific
    websites rather than to any potential attacker. It took me a while to realize that
    this was a vulnerability and could only determine it by reading the source code. These two standalone lines in Anna's code allow for CORS and don't limit who has access:
    <div id="code-ex">
    var cors = require('cors'); <div id="tiny-space"> </div>
    app.use(cors()); 
    </div>
    Proof of Vulnerability: It is difficult to come up with a hard proof for this. However, examples 
    can be given. For example, if this application stored something like
    the user's email in addition to their username then a different website could
    easily access the data if CORS is enabled for any potential attacker. This would
    allow an attacker to retrieve a huge number of emails to then spam. <div id="small-space"></div>
    Resolution: Rather than allowing anyone have CORS access pick specific websites that are allowed. The ability to specify for single routes is
    <a href ="https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html">here.</a>   
    </div>
    <div id="sect_header">V. Conclusion</div>
    <div id="sect_text">
    In conclusion, a lot of damage can be done without even knowing the source code. Additionally, implementing security fixes is quite easy because there
    is so much web development already out there to prevent these kinds of common attacks. Especially when it is viewed as a tradeoff between the danger
    of attacks and the extra work for security-- putting in the extra little bit of time for security is most definitely worth it.
