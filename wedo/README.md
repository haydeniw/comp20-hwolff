1) All parts of this project have been correctly implemented
NOTE: When I ran my style.css through the W3 CSS validator it came out clear, however I am missing a

2) I asked my friend Rachel Ginsberg how long it took her to complete the assignment.
3) Approximately 1.5 hours to complete the assignment.
